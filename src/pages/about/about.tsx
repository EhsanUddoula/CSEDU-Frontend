          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#13274C] mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            The Department of Computer Science and Engineering has been one of the pioneering organizations in the education sector of Bangladesh since its inception in 1992. The department is keen on pushing the boundaries of traditional education system and vigilant to face the challenges that the ever changing field of research brings forth. It is the optimum combination of knowledge generation and application that makes the distinctive feature of the department. 
            <br /><br />
            The department focuses on four major perceptions: 
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Excellence in Education.</strong> From the very beginning, the department is dedicated to provide the best education in the field of Computer Science and Engineering. Armed with a group of experienced faculty and the brightest of students, the department has made exemplary improvement in this field of education. The reflection of this effort can be found amongst the top researchers, programmers, or IT specialists working in top level universities and companies in Bangladesh and all over the world, who graduated from the department. 
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Reputation through Research.</strong> The department focuses heavily on the quality and impact of the researches done in the field of Computer Science and Engineering as well as in multidisciplinary researches conducted in the department. The researches have been focused towards responding to local and global real world crises as well as crossing the frontiers of traditional methods to create new knowledge. 
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Steps towards Society.</strong> The department is always ready to take the responsibility of taking the necessary steps to deploy ICT in social development. The department is keen to fulfill its social responsibility by taking up projects to automate institutional processes at the university and national levels, educate and train people, especially the young people of the country, through workshops on programming, software design, and other ICT training programs. 
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Equality for Everyone.</strong> Everyone in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering is treated and considered as equal. People's past, gender, financial background, ethnicity, religion are not at all considered in the assessment of their present performance. This place gives everyone the opportunity to make a name for themselves and stand out as a member of the CSEDU family. It creates a new identity for the students, one which will be remembered by their department and respected by all. 
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Concoction of Culture.</strong> The department opens its doors towards diversity. People from all over the country, from different cultural backgrounds come to the department and become a part of the same culture that is practised in the department. It's a place for mutual respect and admiration for everyone. This combination of variety ensures an accessible and tolerant environment in the department. An average of 24.59% women out of all students have already pursued degrees from the department which is a reflection of advancement for women in technology in Bangladesh.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#13274C] mb-4">History</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            The journey of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering started in a bright morning of September 1992. It was a brainchild of Dr. M. Lutfar Rahman, a visionary Professor of the Department of Applied Physics and Electronics, University of Dhaka, who felt the urge to come up with an academic department to tackle the snowballing necessity for computer scientists and IT specialists. In spite of a humble beginning, the department, then known as Department of Computer Science, attracted the very best minds of the nation and soon accumulated a star studded faculty roster as well as the brightest of the students. 
            <br /><br />
            The department started with a single classroom offering M.Sc. degree in Computer Science under the Faculty of Science. In 1994, three year B.Sc. Honors program was introduced which was upgraded to four year B.Sc. Honors program in 1997. It is the first department in the Faculty of Science to introduce the four year BSc. program in the University of Dhaka. In 2004, the name of the department was changed to Computer Science and Engineering, leading to its inclusion in the freshly formed Faculty of Engineering and Technology in 2008. In 2010, the four point grading system was introduced in the Faculty of Engineering and Technology. 
            <br /><br />
            Initially, the department started with 20 students in the M.Sc. program in 1992, and then started B.Sc. (Hons) program from 1995 with 21 students. With the increasing demand of Computer Science graduates for the nation, University of Dhaka increased the number of seats for B.Sc. (Hons) program to 60 in 1995. So far, 25 batches have completed their undergraduate studies and 5 batches are currently pursuing their degrees from the department. In addition, 31 batches have completed the graduate study (MSc/ MS) programs and currently 1 batch is continuing their MS coursework/ research. Although only 11 researchers completed PhD from this department, currently there are 4 PhD students pursuing towards their degrees in addition to 1 MPhil students. 
            <br /><br />
            In total, the department has 39 active teachers, 19 of whom have already earned their PhD degrees. Currently,14 faculty members are on leave for pursuing their PhDs from different universities of the world. 
            <br /><br />
            A summary of the faculty members are tinted in the following table:
